*The Inite Game *

Inite is a blockchain game based on a new type of economical and gaming activity. It combines GameFi and Play to Earn on one hand, and the world of ideas backed by NFTs and DAOs on the other. United on the Inite platform, these concepts form a new type of economy based on virtual assets and ideas - ideanomics.   

The main task for every Inite player is the daily creation of 10 ideas and tracking their implementation. Inite players form an active community and discuss gaming activity. The best ideas get support from gaming clans and are tokenized in the form of NFTs.

Every user has their own player character and can upgrade it by creating ideas. Ð¡ompetition between characters and joint raids on bosses is a part of the gaming process. The Inite game combines innovative gamification of the idea creation process and old-school gaming mechanics familiar from the times of Might & Magic Heroes.
