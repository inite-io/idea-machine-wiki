Despite the best efforts of copyright specialists, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect the uniqueness of a technology or development, even in the technical field. The situation is even worse in the field of "pure ideas", where it is almost impossible to prove that you were the originator of any specific concept.

This is where Inite steps in to solve the problem with blockchain technology, by providing users with a tool for free idea tokenization and a mechanism for validation.

Inite is a gaming tool that can help users boost their creativity and cognitive skills by creating and documenting new ideas, building positive habits at the same time. This is all the more relevant today, when the clichéd mindset and fast pace of modern life negatively affect IQ and cognitive abilities. 

Inite also helps address the ongoing problems of lack of money and poverty for developing countries. The “play to earn” model gives anyone with an internet connection the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency and generate a sustainable source of income. Blockchain games can help in the fight against poverty and Inite financially stimulates users to perform useful actions for their personal development.
