title: Idea as a New Type of Asset
---
The main opportunity that the Inite team wants to give our users is in the slogan “Become an Idea Machine”. Our lives are based on ideas, and new disrupting ideas implemented into daily life can turn us into superheroes. 

Inite puts ideas where they should be: first in people’s lives. The real value that stays in our lives comes from ideas. Fiat money today has growing inflation and hasn’t a clear equivalent, that has a real value. Moreover, most “desirable” materials and resources have little worth because they are easily available. And ideas have more than simple value: they are currency, as Inite demonstrates by tokenizing ideas in the form of NFTs and giving people the ability to exchange and monetize their inventions.

Of course, we must not forget that everything in crypto is based on ideas, too. The ideas of freedom and decentralization, popular among the cypherpunks, inspired the invention of blockchain. We can’t even begin to guess how many ideas patented on the Inite platform will be implemented in - and profoundly change - the real world. 

On a personal level, experienced Inite users will not be confused in any situation and will come up with a solution where an ordinary person would get confused. In whatever situation you find yourself in, you'll have a thousand ideas. You'll know what to answer, no matter what question you're asked. At every meeting, you'll be so far out of the ordinary that you'll find yourself on another level. If you’re on an empty road, you'll find a way to get to civilization; if you need to make money urgently, you’ll find 50 ways to do it, and so on.



### Tokenization of Ideas 

Despite the best efforts of copyright specialists, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect the uniqueness of technology or development, even in the technical field. The situation is even worse in the lot of "pure ideas”, where it is almost impossible to prove that you were the originator of any specific concept. This is where Inite solves the problem with blockchain technology by providing users with a tool for free idea tokenization and a mechanism for validation.

Inite is a gaming tool that can help users boost their creativity and cognitive skills by creating and documenting new ideas building positive habits at the same time. This is all the more relevant today, when the clichéd mindset and fast pace of modern life negatively affect IQ and cognitive abilities.

Inite also helps address the ongoing lack of money and poverty for developing countries. The “play to earn” model gives anyone with an internet connection the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency and generate a sustainable source of income. Blockchain games can help in the fight against poverty, and Inite financially stimulates users to perform useful actions for their personal development.
