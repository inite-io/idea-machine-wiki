title: Idea as a New Type of Asset

<!--StartFragment-->

The main opportunity that the Inite team wants to give our users is in the slogan “Become an Idea Machine”. Our lives are based on ideas, and new disrupting ideas implemented into daily life can turn us into superheroes. 

Inite puts ideas where they should be: in first place in people’s lives. The real value that stays in our lives comes from ideas. Money is no longer backed by real value, and most “desirable” materials and resources have little worth because they are easily available. And ideas have more than simple value: they are currency, as Inite demonstrates by tokenizing ideas in the form of NFTs and giving people the ability to exchange and monetize their inventions.

Of course, we must not forget that everything in crypto is based on ideas, too. It was the ideas of freedom and decentralization, popular among the cypherpunks, that inspired the invention of blockchain. We can’t even begin to guess how many ideas patented on the Inite platform will be implemented in - and profoundly change - the real world. 

On a personal level, experienced Inite users will not be confused in any situation and will be able to come up with a solution where an ordinary person would get confused. In whatever situation you find yourself, you'll have a thousand ideas. You'll know what to answer, no matter what question you're asked. At every meeting, you'll be so far out of the ordinary that you'll find yourself on another level. If you’re on an empty road, you'll find a way to get to civilization; if you need to make money urgently, you’ll find 50 ways to do it, and so on.
