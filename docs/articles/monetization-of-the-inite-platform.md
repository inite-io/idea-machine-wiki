The Inite platform must attract investment to support ideanomics. The primary sources of these funds are subscriptions for additional gaming features and fees from in-game features.

Subscriptions on the Inite platform are charged monthly. These services give users additional opportunities, such as:

1. Double experience
2. One gift item per week
3. Recognition of ideas from a photo
4. Voice-to-text transfer of ideas
5. Clan creation
6. Upgrade characteristics twice a day



The platform also takes fees for some types of economic activity on the platform:

1. Sales of NFT equipment 
2. Sales of NFT pets
3. Advertising in users’ feed
4. Sales of NPCs
5. Creation of a clan
6. AI idea generation  



### Tokenomics

\
The Inite platform has 2 tokens, INIT and IDEA, and both built on NEAR Protocol.

INIT is a governance token. It’s available for staking and can be obtained in challenges. The number of tokens in circulation changes and depends on players’ activity. 

IDEA is an internal gaming currency used to buy premium functions and equipment. The player can spend Inite for premium items, access to AI idea generator and another gaming features. Users can reward each other for social activities like writing comments, idea reviews, idea sharing, and getting likes for an idea. There is a program for minting and burning these tokens, covered later.
