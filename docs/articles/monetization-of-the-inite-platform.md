1. Double experience
2. One gift item per week
3. Recognition of ideas from a photo
4. Voice-to-text transfer of ideas
5. Clan creation
6. Upgrade characteristics twice a day



The platform also takes fees for some types of economic activity on the platform:

1. Sales of NFT equipment 
2. Sales of NFT pets
3. Advertising in users’ feed
4. Sales of NPCs
5. Creation of a clan
6. AI idea generation
