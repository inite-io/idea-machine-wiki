title: Types of Idea Challenges on the Inite Platform
---
<!--StartFragment-->

Inite is designed to host idea challenges, in which every participating player has a defined amount of time (from a day to a month or more) to create an idea on a given topic. The Inite platform gives INIT tokens for participation.Â 

There are currently three types of challenge:

* Challenges directly from the Inite platform team are rewarded with INIT tokens, IDEA tokens and double experience
* Users can create their own challenges and define their own rewards in INIT or IDEA tokens
* Partner challenges are only open to users who hold NFTs from the partner. Rewards are INIT tokens and bonuses from the partner
