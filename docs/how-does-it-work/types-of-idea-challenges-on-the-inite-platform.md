title: Quests and Challenges on the Inite Platform
---
To make progress in the game, pump up their characters and receive rewards, players perform two types of in-game tasks: challenges and quests.



### Challenges

Challenges are special tasks. Some are available for all types of players, while others have experience, health and level requirements. Other challenges are available to users with sufficient fame on the platform (amount of likes) or are special tasks for the clan.

There are currently three types of challenges:

* Challenges directly from the Inite platform team are rewarded with INIT tokens, IDEA tokens and double experience
* Users can create their own challenges and define their own rewards in INIT or IDEA tokens
* Partner challenges are only open to users who hold NFTs from the partner. Rewards are INIT tokens and bonuses from the partner



Challenges on the Inite platform usually consist of several interrelated tasks, though a challenge can consist of just one task in special cases. Inite challenges can be launched only by the Inite team and partner tasks only by Inite partners. Any Inite platform member can create their own challenge and make it available on the platform by paying a fee for launching the challenge and reserving INIT or other in-game items in escrow to be awarded to challenge winners as prizes. 

Every player can check and join clan challenges on the Clans forum. You can check and launch personal challenges in the “Challenges” menu. Some clan challenges are available only to clan members who meet specific requirements. All available challenges for the public, clans and your character can be found in “Public Challenges”.

Most challenges are related to idea creation tasks in which every participating player has a defined amount of time (from a day to a month or more) to create an idea on a given topic. For example, it could be creating a startup name or special tasks from large brands like Coca-Cola. Some challenges may be lifestyle tasks like stopping smoking or giving up alcohol; some may be charity tasks. Any user can launch any task that does not go against the platform’s rules. 

Clans and guilds can launch group tasks for their members like supporting clan ideas, writing reviews, joining a poll or voting for clan members. The challenge creator can close entry at any time and appoint the winner in accordance with the previously announced rules. The Inite team can mediate in cases of non-compliance with the challenge’s terms by the challenge creator. In the future, it will be possible to create a special community court to resolve such issues. 



### Quests

There are two main types of quests: collection quests and boss quests. To damage a boss or make an essential action the user needs to make a positive click during the playing day. To start a quest, a player must join or create a clan: players can invite clan members to quests, or try them alone if the clan has only one member. Creating ideas, acquiring good habits and performing challenges also influence quest progress.

Completing quests is one of the constant goals for clans, as completion brings rewards in the form of experience points and items distributed among quest participants. To start a quest, the player should choose it in the “List of Quests”, which displays all available quests of different types and their rewards. 

Some quests are available for free, but most cost INIT or IDEA tokens.The player must go to the Quest Shop to purchase quests in the ”Inventory” menu. Some quests are only available after a player or clan has reached certain game milestones or levels.
