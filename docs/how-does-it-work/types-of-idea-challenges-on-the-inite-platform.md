To make progress in the game, pump up their characters and receive rewards, players perform two types of in-game tasks: challenges and quests.

Challenges are special tasks. Some are available for all types of players, while others have experience, health and level requirements. Other challenges are available to users with sufficient fame on the platform (amount of likes) or are special tasks for the clan.

There are currently three types of challenges:

* Challenges directly from the Inite platform team are rewarded with INIT tokens, IDEA tokens and double experience
* Users can create their own challenges and define their own rewards in INIT or IDEA tokens
* Partner challenges are only open to users who hold NFTs from the partner. Rewards are INIT tokens and bonuses from the partner

Challenges on the Inite platform usually consist of several interrelated tasks, though can consist of just one task in special cases. Any Inite platform member can create their own challenge and make it available on the platform by paying a fee for launching the challenge and reserving INIT or other in-game items in escrow to be awarded to winners as prizes. 

Special challenges can be launched only by entities that have organized them. Group challenges need the approval of the clan or guild that supports them. Obviously, Inite challenges can be launched only by the Inite team and partner tasks only by Inite partners.

Every player can check and join clan challenges on the Clans forum. The same algorithm works for Guild forums. 

You can check and launch personal challenges in the “Challenges” menu. Some clan challenges are available only to clan members who meet specific requirements. All available challenges for the public, clans and your character can be found in “Public Challenges”.

Most challenges are related to idea creation tasks in which every participating player has a defined amount of time (from a day to a month or more) to create an idea on a given topic. For example, it could be creating a startup name or special tasks from large brands like Coca-Cola. Some challenges may be lifestyle tasks like stopping smoking or giving up alcohol; some may be charity tasks. Any user can launch any task that does not go against the platform’s rules. 



### Groups and Challenges

Clans and guilds can launch group tasks for their members like supporting clan ideas, writing reviews, joining a poll, or voting for clan members. The challenge creator can close entry at any time and appoint the winner according to the previously announced rules. The Inite team can mediate in cases of non-compliance with the challenge’s terms by the challenge creator. In the future, it will be possible to create a special community court to resolve such issues. 

Guilds contain a large variety of challenges. If you click on the challenge, you can get to the page of general challenges and find out more about both the challenges themselves and participation in them. 

Guild leaders can allow other members to create challenges or prevent anyone but themselves from doing so. Challenges that are created in the guild are visible to its members and those who have preliminary access. Creating guilds is possible only on the full PC version of the site.

Prize money is deposited by the creator of the guild in its guild bank and will be used for challenges. If the guild bank runs out, prize money can be taken from the guild leader's account. Also, players can share prize money with each other. 

Each challenge has a unique identifier, which consists of letters and numbers. You can publish this link in public places in Inite to invite players to join. (If this challenge is for a guild, they will first need to join your guild.) If the player clicks on the challenge link, they will only see the description and quests.
