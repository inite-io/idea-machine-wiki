<!--StartFragment-->

The class system in the game is based on four key players characteristics: Physical Intelligence (PQ), intelligence Quotient (IQ), Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Spiritual Intelligence (SQ). 

All characters start as warriors and may choose a class when they reach level 10. There are four main classes in the game: Warrior, Healer, Rogue and Mage. Each class has unique advantages and disadvantages, special bonuses, extra skills and inventory. After the player chooses a class, they can use magic and the mana attribute appears.

Physical Intelligence (PQ) affects critical hits and boss damage. Players of any class can increase PQ by using armor and weapons or spending stat points. It’s the primary characteristic for warriors and secondary for rogues.  

Emotional Intelligence (EQ) affects the level of defense and health points. A high EQ will decrease the amount of damage dealt to a character by not completing quests, but will not reduce damage from bosses. This is the primary characteristic for healers and secondary for warriors.

Intelligence Quotient (IQ) affects the amount of experience points (XP) and mana points. A player with high IQ gets to the next level faster, has more mana points and regenerates mana faster. This is the primary characteristic for mages and secondary for healers.

Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) affects the speed of getting drops and gold points when completing a quest. It also increases the chance of randomly getting an extra item or a higher reward for completing a quest. This characteristic is primary for rogues and secondary for mages.



### Warrior

Primary characteristic: Physical Intelligence (PQ)

Secondary characteristic: Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

Warriors have more chances for critical damage, inflict higher damage against bosses and can add their PQ and IQ to the party. They also have a higher chance for random rewards, balanced by lower XP gain. For the party, a warrior is essential during boss fights. It’s a good class for newbies, since a warrior is the basic class for all characters below level 10 and has relatively simple gameplay.



### Mage

Primary characteristic: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)

Secondary characteristic: Spiritual Intelligence (SQ)

Mages level faster since they get more XP. They also have a large mana pool, which regenerates quickly. Mages add their IQ and SQ to the party. Moreover, the mage is essential during boss fights since they can generate large amounts of damage, balanced by lower health and defense points.

    

### Healer 

Primary characteristic: Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

Secondary characteristic: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)

The basic skill of the healer is to heal themself and clan members, making this team member absolutely indispensable during fights with bosses. The level of damage that the healer can cause is lower than the other classes. The healer also adds their EQ and IQ to the clan. 



### Rogue

Primary characteristic: Spiritual Intelligence (SQ)

Secondary characteristic: Physical Intelligence (PQ)

The rogue is the best economic unit in the Inite metaverse, useful for collection tasks, equipment upgrades and finding gold and drops. This class also adds their SQ and PQ to the clan. The rogue’s disadvantage is low boss damage. 



### Changing Class

The player’s first choice of character class is free. To change class after the initial choice, the player uses a special item called a “Rebirth ring” and can also redistribute characteristic points. Rebirth rings are available on the Inite marketplace or can be found during play.
