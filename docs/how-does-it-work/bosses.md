title: Bosses
---
Bosses are powerful units in the Inite game. You can fight them using the quest system. All players participating in a quest can attack the boss together. The benefits of defeating a boss are huge, but the damage - and therefore the risk - is high, too. It is equally important to accomplish ideas and tasks to prevent extra damage to the team.  

Damage to the boss depends on many parameters. Physical intelligence (PQ) affects boss damage and critical hits. All players can use stat points or weapons and armor to increase PQ. A high EQ will reduce the amount of indirect damage dealt to a character by not completing quests, but it will not reduce damage from bosses.

Damage to the boss is calculated and dealt with in Cron. One of the main Cron functions is to cause damage to the player for any scheduled tasks that they did not complete. If the player is taking part in a Boss Quest, Cron will also cause the boss to do additional damage to the player and do that same amount of damage to all other players in the quest.

Fighting with bosses makes the game more challenging because of multiplying damage. Even players in the Inn can take damage from other clan members participating in the fight, thus increasing motivation.\
\
When the boss is defeated, all players in the clan gain rewards: gold, experience, and artifacts. To join the fray you need to create your ideas, and develop them with your teammates. There are various types of bosses by health and special abilities. For example, some bosses have Rage, which increases their health bar if your team members personally miss their daily idea creation.  \
\
Every boss has a health bar that shows total and current health. Some bosses also have a mana bar charged by your clan’s incomplete tasks.  Damage to a boss multiplies with each character’s skills. If one player fails in new idea making, the boss damages all members of the clan. Damage depends on the strength ratio of the boss. Despite their character constitution and armor, all players take equal damage from the boss.  

There are a lot of cool bosses. Despite their hilarious names, you shouldn’t underestimate their devastating might!  There are also a more powerful type of bosses - World Bosses. They appear in the special worldwide quest everyone must take part in. The game mechanics are the same as for normal bosses - by making ideas - but users can also activate very strong abilities such as Burst of Flames or Brutal Smash. All Inite players are rewarded for this fight.



**Wrathful Boss**             

A Wrathful Boss is a special type of boss for standard quests that deals damage to the team and has a rage bar. These bosses heal themselves when the bar is full. Missed dailies increase the boss's power, which fills up the Rage bar.



**World Bosses**

The World Boss is a boss in a special type of quest that all Inite users participate in. At the end of the fight, all users will be rewarded - even those who rested in the inn or did not use the platform during the entire time of the quest. Damage is dealt to a World Boss in the same way as a normal Boss: by completing quests, habits, and dailies, as well as by the Flame Surge and Slam skills. You will not deal damage if you decide to rest in the inn during the world boss quest. As with quest bosses, the player's influence on the health and rage of the world boss is calculated by the Cron.
