The player’s main purpose is to come up with a variety of ideas every day and track the progress of their implementation by discussing those ideas and forming a community around them. To earn rewards, players develop their character by generating ideas and putting them in a table. Random rewards for completing idea lists help to equip their character, and the chat room gives the opportunity to discuss cooperation between players and choose the best ideas.

Rewards encourage users to create new ideas and buy better gear, and also to spend tokens on gear improvements to kill stronger bosses to get even better gear. The player’s avatar competes with other characters, improves his or her skills and buys equipment such as weapons, spells, and armor.

The order of the user's actions within the system is as follows:

* User creates an idea
* User writes out the idea to receive experience points and items
* User publishes the idea and receives tokens and other rewards from the Inite community 
* User spends tokens on equipment
* User joins in a boss hunt with other players
* Equipment and support of teammates help users to get more rewards and win



Important elements of the game’s mechanics for the user are:

1. Experience - the higher the level, the more income and opportunities
2. Money - your tokens; connect your wallet and they become blockchain tokens you can convert into any currency
3. Health - decreases if you come up with less than 10 ideas per day; if your character dies, you will lose some of your money and equipment
4. Ideas - a handy list of ideas to keep track of, on any device. You can share ideas with your friends or sell them on the marketplace
5. NFT idea - the ability to fix authorship of an idea on the blockchain without disclosing its description
6. NFT marketplace - to sell and buy ideas
7. Shop - to buy equipment for IDEA tokens (opening soon)
8. Bosses - the opportunity to call friends and hunt bosses for especially valuable rewards and a chance of INIT tokens (coming soon)
