title: Combat System and Skills

<!--StartFragment-->

Every in-game character has 7 defining characteristics (or “stats”, for those familiar with tabletop RPGs):

* Physical Intelligence (PQ)
* IQ
* Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
* Spiritual Intelligence (SQ)
* Charisma 
* Agility 
* Luck 

At the beginning of the game, each stat is set to 5. Players distribute 10 points between these stats to personalize their character.

The amount of health depends on Emotional intelligence. Mana depends on Spiritual Intelligence. Health is lost during boss battles, for unfulfilled promises (such as daily ideas), and notification of work on the idea. 

Reaching a new character level fully replenishes health and mana. Generating new ideas partially replenishes health and mana. Vampirism items or skills help restore health.

Effectiveness in boss battles depends on multiple parameters, such as the character’s PQ (hit power), Agility (number of hits and chance to dodge boss attacks), Luck - chance of critical hit, SQ (chance to hit), Charisma (experience gained), and IQ (power of applied skills).
