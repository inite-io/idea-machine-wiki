## Damage

As in all games, Inite interprets game damage, when a player receives it, a notification about the loss of health points (HP) appears in the upper right corner of the interface. As soon as HP reaches 0, the player dies.

Players can take damage from several sources:

* Boss attack. An attack occurs every time a player or his team members do not come up with 10 ideas before the cron update. (Cron is a term meaning a scheduled recurring event. The cron cycle lasts 24 hours. All players start a new day at midnight according to their time zone.)
* Also, a small amount of damage is caused due to unrealized 10 ideas before launching cron. (There are two scenarios: either the boss will attack you, which will entail a greater amount of damage received, or you will simply receive minor damage)

Damage is calculated from several factors, including the complexity and value of the idea, as well as the physique of the player.

Players have the opportunity to use data analysis to assess the amount of damage they receive and assess possible risks.

But not everything is as bad as it seemed. The damage received can be reduced by increasing your physique. Physique characteristics, like everything else, can be increased in several ways:

* Level increases
* Improvement of certain types of equipment (Armor)
* Purchase of effects
* Distribution of points of characteristics
* Pay attention to the definition of the class: **Healers and warriors** have a **larger physique compared** to other classes.

## In-game Treatment

The game implements the mechanics of replenishing your health, which will help increase the chances of survival in the current or next boss fight. Players can replenish their HP with:

* Healer Skills
* Buying a Health Elixir
* Character level-up (Fully regenerates health)

Vampirism items or skills help restore health.
The player also has tokens, which are mostly needed for in-game purchases, and the player can also spend them on a couple of side effects to temporarily improve the character's skills/abilities.

## Characteristic

Each character has 4 characteristics

* PQ - Physical Intelligence (Impact Strength)
* IQ - Intelligence Quotient, increases skill strength
* EQ - Emotional Intelligence
* SQ - Spiritual Intelligence

At the beginning of the game, each indicator is equal to 5 points, and players are also given 10 more points for their own distribution between indicators to personalize their character.

From **EQ** - Depends on the amount of **maximum health** of the character
From **SQ** - Depends on the amount of **maximum** possible accumulated **mana** from the character (Increasing the player's level completely **restores not only health, but also mana**)
Efficiency in boss battles depends on **PQ and IQ**
