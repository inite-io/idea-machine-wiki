title: In the Beginning
---
The player’s primary purpose is to come up with various ideas every day and track the progress of their implementation by discussing those ideas and forming a community around them. To earn rewards, players develop their character by generating ideas and putting them in a table. Random rewards for completing idea lists help to equip their character, and the chat room gives the opportunity to discuss cooperation between players and choose the best ideas.

Rewards encourage users to create new ideas, buy better gear, and spend tokens on gear improvements to kill stronger bosses to get even better gear. The player’s avatar competes with other characters, improves their skills and buys gaming equipment such as weapons, spells, and armor.

The order of the user's actions within the system is as follows:

* User creates an idea
* User writes out the idea to receive experience points and items
* User publishes the idea and receives tokens and other rewards from the Inite community 
* User spends tokens on equipment
* User joins in a boss hunt with other players
* Equipment and support of teammates help users to get more rewards and win

Essential elements of the game’s mechanics for the user are:

1. Experience - the higher the level, the more income, and opportunities.
2. Money - your tokens; connect your wallet, and they become blockchain tokens you can convert into any currency.
3. Health - decreases if you come up with less than 10 ideas per day; if your character dies, you will lose some of your money and equipment.
4. Ideas - a handy list of ideas to keep track of, on any device. You can share ideas with your friends or sell them on the marketplace.
5. NFT idea - the ability to fix the authorship of an idea on the blockchain without disclosing its description.
6. NFT marketplace - to sell and buy ideas
7. Shop - to buy equipment for IDEA tokens (opening soon)
8. Bosses - the opportunity to call friends and hunt bosses for especially valuable rewards and a chance of INIT tokens (coming soon)

The whole game for the user begins with filling out a list of ideas. For each idea, the user receives their first reward in the form of experience points and IDEA tokens and, by completing the sheet, receives their first character level increase.

The first reward can be used to buy equipment, and the points received after leveling up can be used to increase basic characteristics: Physical Intelligence (PQ), Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Spiritual Intelligence (SQ). The user can now enter challenges, join a clan and participate in quests and boss hunts.

Rewarding ideas prompts players to create new ideas, buy even better equipment, and spend tokens to improve existing equipment to kill stronger bosses and get even better equipment.
