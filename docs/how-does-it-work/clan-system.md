Decentralization and Web3 as a service are important parts of the current blockchain revolution. DAOs allow users to unite in groups and govern assets together. Inite users will have this ability in the game - to create and join clans (in the form of DAOs) based on their values and area(s) of interest.

Users will earn experience and tokens for each “like” of the idea and get the opportunity to join or be invited to join a clan or group. Active participants create their clans, recruit colleagues, and bring the idea to life, earning from the price growth of the idea token. In doing so, DAO clan participants in the Inite ecosystem support each other financially and manage assets.

Clans will implement and patent ideas, and idea authors will make money. Eventually this ecosystem will result in all members of the overall Inite DAO getting their share of every idea in the Inite community. DAO members can also help each other come up with and implement new ideas and teach each other useful skills.

The group leader uses a boss summoning scroll. The group embarks on a boss hunt, during which time members can communicate in the group and discuss the implementation of the idea and available resources.  Clan members can invite other players to join. There are no limits on character class or player level to join the clan with an invitation. Clans can consist of up to 30 members. 

The player who starts the clan is awarded the position of the group leader. It can manage the clan, invite and remove members, change the clan’s name and description, or transfer leadership. Each clan has a chat room for interaction and discussion between clan members - beneficial for quests, boss hunts, and in-game challenges.
