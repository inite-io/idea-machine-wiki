title: Clan System

<!--StartFragment-->

Decentralization and Web3 as a service is an important part of the current blockchain revolution. DAOs give users an opportunity to unite in groups and govern assets together. Inite users will have this ability in the game - to create and join clans (in the form of DAOs) based on their values and area(s) of interest.

User will earn experience and tokens for each “like” of the idea, and will also get the opportunity to join or be invited to join a clan or group. Active participants create their own clans, recruit colleagues, and together bring the idea to life, earning from the price growth of the idea token. In doing so, DAO clan participants in the Inite ecosystem support each other financially and manage assets.

Clans will implement and patent ideas, and idea authors will make money. Eventually this ecosystem will result in all members of the overall Inite DAO getting their share of every idea in the Inite community. DAO members can also help each other come up with and implement new ideas, as well as teach each other useful skills.

The leader in the group can use the boss summoning scroll and the group will embark on a boss hunt, during which time you can communicate in the group and discuss the implementation of the idea and available resources.
