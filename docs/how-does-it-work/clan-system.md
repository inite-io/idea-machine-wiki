Decentralization and Web3 as a service are important parts of the current blockchain revolution. DAOs allow users to unite in groups and govern assets together. Inite users will have this ability in the game - to create and join clans (in the form of DAOs) based on their values and area(s) of interest.

Users will earn experience and tokens for each “like” of their idea and get the opportunity to join or be invited to join a clan. Active participants create their clans, recruit colleagues, and bring the idea to life, earning from the price growth of the idea token. In doing so, DAO clan participants in the Inite ecosystem support each other financially and manage assets.

Clans will implement and patent ideas, and idea authors will make money. Eventually, this ecosystem will result in all members of the overall Inite DAO getting their share of every idea in the Inite community. DAO members can also help each other come up with and implement new ideas and teach each other valuable skills.

The player who starts the clan is awarded the position of group leader. He can manage the clan, invite and remove members, change the clan’s name and description, or transfer leadership. Each clan has a chat room for interaction and discussion between clan members - beneficial for quests, boss hunts, and in-game challenges.

Usually, a class has two main types of equipment that increase their primary stat, and two that raise their secondary stat. Gear for the first stat pumps it much more at each level than equipment for the second stat. 

The group leader can use a boss summoning scroll. The group embarks on a boss hunt, during which members can communicate in the group and discuss the implementation of the idea and available resources. 

Clan members can invite other players to join. There are no limits on character class or player level to join the clan with an invitation. Clans can consist of up to 30 members. 

There are exceptions to this scheme. For example, Mages carry a two-handed weapon, so they only have 3 equipment slots. Their weapons perform a function that would take 2 slots for other classes.

**Class Equip Bonus**

Each piece of equipment of its class that the player uses increases the usefulness of his most suitable attribute by 50%, making equipment use essential during joint clan quests. 

Players can wear some gear from another class and still get the class bonus for the class gear they are utilizing. For instance, if a player is a Rogue but is wearing the Warrior's Golden Armor, they will still get a class bonus for the Rogue's Ninja-to if they are using it.

In case of players want to wear another class's equipment for aesthetic reasons, they would wear an outfit and wear their more powerful class equipment into combat.

Nevertheless, certain equipment from another class can be stronger than the present class's ultimate gear.

Legendary equipment is only unlocked through assembling a series of quests and it’s available to any class. It does not confer a class equip bonus but is usually better than even the most potent class-specific weapon or armor.
