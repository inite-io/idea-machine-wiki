<!--StartFragment-->

The player's task is not to come up with the perfect idea. It is primarily a cognitive task of speed and originality of thinking. First of all, it is important to create ideas without thinking about whether they are bad or good, or even whether they can be put into practice. That is, the main thing is not to worry about the application of invented ideas in real life.

Inite’s gameplay design and the development of cognitive abilities requires players to set themselves targets for time and the number of ideas, which points their creative energy in the right direction. 

If we come up with everyday ideas and solutions for rearranging the living room, for example, then at the very beginning we only need to write out the existing 20-30 popular options. Then we can add the rarer and more complex variants of these layouts. Finally, options for these layouts with some unusual solutions/details and then different original ideas that come to mind on the basis of combining these options. In the process of fixing ideas, it is very important to write down all options without rejecting them.

So far, a human does this job of collecting existing options, trying them out and combining them better than AI, but we are already introducing AI tools into our game that can do these tasks without user input.
