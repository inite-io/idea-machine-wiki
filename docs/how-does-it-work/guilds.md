title: Guilds

Guilds are social groups connecting players with the same beliefs and common goals in the Inite world of ideas. There are different unification principles: occupation in real life, political views, hobbies, etc. Full information can be obtained from the Guild's Guide. While the clan system limits membership for each user to a single clan, guild memberships are not limited.\

It is essential to understand that there are no direct benefits for players from participation in guilds: no additional skills or armor. However, guild members can communicate in their chat and take part in the guild’s challenges. 



There are two types of guilds: public and private. Challenges from public gulds are free to join for every player in Inite.  By default, the top 30 most popular guilds are shown in the list of public guilds. By using keywords in search, you can find guilds that are relevant to your interests and goals. Narrow your search by choosing Category, Role, or Guild size.

You can look through the Guilds page to check all the guilds you participate in. Guilds contain forums with common topics of interest. You can format your text in various ways using emojis, participating in guild discussions by posting messages in the chatbox. Sent messages can’t be edited but can be deleted. All guild members receive notifications of new messages from chat if the guild has fewer than 5,000 members. 

A guild leader needs to decide whether they will be private or public. If the guild was set up as a private guild and you want to make it public, it's worth asking the members if they're willing to share their conversations with outside members. It is advisable to wait a month to see the topic and make an informed decision. 

Also, before making the guild public, make sure that it does not contain material that may offend others, incite hatred, uses obscene language, or calls for violence. 

Once your checks are complete and your membership happy with the switch, write to the admin to change the type of your guild. 

When a private guild appears, all phenomena automatically appear and cannot be restored. Public guilds are not automatically deleted: they continue to exist and appear in search results, and you can join them. 

If the owner of a public guild does not log into the account for more than 6 months without leaving a will, the guild bot will automatically summon pirates. Pirates will ask who wishes to take the post of guild leader in the chat and appoint a replacement without involving the platform administrator.



Only the administrator of our portal can delete guilds. Suppose you are the leader of a community and want to remove it. In that case, the administrator will consider whether there are active members, calls in the guild, or if it might be wiser to give your position to another player and save the community. If you are determined to delete the community, contact the administrator, indicating:

\- Guild name

\- Community address

\- Your reason(s) for deletion

In principle, you can simply leave the guild. In this case, the administrator himself will pass leadership to an appointed replacement or find a successor for you.
