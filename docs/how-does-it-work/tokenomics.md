The Inite platform has 2 tokens, INIT and IDEA, both built on NEAR Protocol.

IDEA is an internal gaming currency used to buy premium functions and equipment, and for users to reward each other for social activities. There is a program for minting and burning these tokens, covered later. 

INIT is a governance token. It’s available for staking and can be obtained in challenges. The number of tokens in circulation changes all the time and depends on players’ activity.
