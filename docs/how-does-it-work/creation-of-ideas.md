title: "Creation of Ideas "

Every Inite platform user can issue and attribute their ideas to NFTs. The idea is fixed on the blockchain together with the date of its origin. This way, every Inite user can prove ownership and guarantee that their ideas will not be stolen. This mechanism will be improved in the future.

The platform stimulates user activity to capture all possible (and impossible) ideas. Any user can create ideas, issue an NFT and sell it on Initeâ€™s NFT marketplace. The sales mechanics are similar to Rarible or OpenSea trades. The idea creator gets their share from reselling.

In the next phase of Inite's development, we plan to integrate ideas generated by members with patent offices and other institutions working in the ideas market. Ultimately, this should change the current trend that "an idea costs nothing" and provide the DAO and NFT integration to allow the original author of the idea to earn from it.
