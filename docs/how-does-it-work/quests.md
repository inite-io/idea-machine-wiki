title: Quests

There are two main types of quests: collection quests and boss quests. To damage a boss or make an essential action the user needs to make a positive click during the playing day. To start a quest, a player must join or create a clan: players can invite clan members to quests, or try them alone if the clan has only one member. Creating ideas and performing challenges also influence quest progress. 

Completing quests is one of the constant goals for clans, as completion brings rewards in the form of experience points and items distributed among quest participants. To start a quest, the player should choose it in the “List of Quests”, which displays all available quests of different types and their rewards. 

Some quests are available for free, but most cost INIT or IDEA tokens. The player must go to the Quest Shop to purchase quests in the ”Inventory” menu. Some quests are only available after a player or clan has reached certain game milestones or levels. 



Some collecting quests (those that immediately give items that improve your characteristics) are given out for free to all players after reaching a certain level. Others can be bought with internal game payment methods - INIT or IDEA tokens. Only team members who have accepted the quest will participate.

As soon as all participants accept the invitations or the owner of the quest presses the "Start" button, the quest is activated. It is at this point that the quest scroll is consumed from the quest owner's inventory.

**Boss quests**

The boss appears on the sidebar of the team, with a health bar. Completing quests, tasks, or dailies will deal damage to the boss proportional to the value of the quests and the player's Physical Intelligence (PQ). The damage dealt to the team depends on the daily quest list, if it has one. Flame Surge and Slam also deal damage to the boss. Players can open "Data Analysis" to find out how much damage will be dealt to the boss.



A boss quest started at the end of the day will still grant damage to the boss for dailies completed before the quest started. If any quest member misses their dailies, the boss can deal damage to all quest participants. The amount of damage is based on the number and value of unfulfilled dailies, as well as the strength of the boss. This damage will even apply to members who are resting in an inn or who have already died before.

**Collecting quests**

Collecting quests require you to find a certain number of specified items by completing dailies, tasks, and creation of ideas. Any task can lead to the loss of both a regular trophy and a quest one; however, both trophy systems operate independently. Due to the lack of a boss, no additional damage is dealt for unfulfilled dailies. Unlike boss quests, the progress of a collecting quest started at the end of the day will not be affected by dailies completed before it starts.
