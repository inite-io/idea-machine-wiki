The main point of this game is to help people develop their cognitive skills by creating ideas. The main tasks are to help people begin to think actively about the meaning of their lives and their individual purpose.

The basic mechanic of the Inite platform is based on users writing out ideas every day and breaking them down into daily, monthly, and yearly intervals to help schedule time and set life goals. Ideas are represented in the form of NFTs. 

Solving problems requires new approaches that go beyond traditional ways of thinking. It requires that people know how to integrate disparate areas of knowledge, in particular, to combine creative and scientific thinking. 

Inite users will develop their brains and see more options for solving problems in everyday life. And according to statistics, a couple of ideas among their annual 3,650 (10 ideas per day * 365 days) will be super ideas that may become their next business.
