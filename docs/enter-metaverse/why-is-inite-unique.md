## Why is Inite Unique?

Inite is a unique project that combines gaming and intellectual activities and an educational and social component. Inite promotes the trend for games to be both interesting and useful, and a new type of economy tied to this - ideanomics.

The world of ideas is almost stagnant. Too many people look to material things for comfort, happiness, and a way to fill the lack of purpose in their lives - material things made by advanced manufacturing machines in a global economy that makes for easy exchanges between commodities, goods, and materials. Yet our ideas are the most important thing that makes us unique and different from each other. At the same time, all idea-related institutions - universities, patent offices, political parties, and religious organizations - work in the same old-fashioned manner. Their mechanics for proof of authorship and working with ideas come mostly from the 19th or, at best, the 20th century.

Inite brings to the crypto space an ability to create ideas in the form of NFTs and prove authorship. People can share their ideas inside the community without fear of intellectual theft. Moreover, they can get the support of the Inite community and find the best ideas that will change their lives or those around them. The creation of ideas on Inite can also result in creating a team to implement the idea, supported by the community. 

Inite makes it possible to give ideas real economic power, which is still absent in the mainstream economy. And as a part of the creative economy, Inite facilitates the birth of a new type of creators - idea creators. 



### Cognitive Importance of the Inite Platform

The main point of this game is to help people develop their cognitive skills by creating ideas. The main tasks help people think actively about the meaning of their lives and their purpose.

The basic mechanic of the Inite platform is based on users writing out ideas every day and breaking them down into daily, monthly, and yearly intervals to help schedule time and set life goals. Ideas are represented in the form of NFTs. 

Solving problems requires new approaches that go beyond traditional ways of thinking. It requires that people know how to integrate disparate areas of knowledge, in particular, to combine creative and scientific thinking. 

Inite users will develop their brains and see more options for solving problems in everyday life. And according to statistics, a couple of ideas among their annual 3,650 (10 ideas per day * 365 days) will be super ideas that may become their next business.
