The basic mechanic of the Inite platform is based on users writing out ideas every day and breaking them down into daily, monthly, and yearly intervals to help schedule time and set life goals. Ideas are represented in the form of NFTs. 

Users not only suggest and fix their ideas, but are rewarded in game tokens (see below). Each idea can become the subject of discussion within the community and get support and feedback. And if a user generates revolutionary ideas, they can sell those innovations in the form of NFT tokens on the Idea Marketplace.  

Key features of the Inite platform are:

* Tokenized economy allows you to earn from your ideas
* Built-in market for buying and selling NFT items
* AI for generating ideas for a given theme
* Engaging battles with bosses
* Real-time communication with like-minded people
* Clan system and ability to create DAOs
* Referral system
