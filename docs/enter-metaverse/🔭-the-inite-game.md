## The Inite Game 

Inite is a blockchain game based on a new type of economical and gaming activity. It  combines innovative gamification of the idea creation process and old-school gaming mechanics familiar from the times of Might & Magic Heroes.

Behind Inite itself stands a special game philosophy centered on the development of both individuals and society through positive and mobilizing ideas. Ideas encourage people to change for the better, to change their lifestyles and habits, and constant contact with the world of ideas improves a person's cognitive abilities. Discussing ideas in the community provides an opportunity to validate them, develop them, and verify their value. Through in-game mechanics, Inite promotes this philosophy and Inite users are regularly motivated through rewards to change themselves and the world around them for the better. Another type of motivation for idea creators on the Inite platform is social approval.

Inite has a multitude of original ideas and unique mechanics. It is a GameFi and Play to Earn project, it is the metaverse of ideas backed by NFTs, and it is a community of clans governed by DAOs. United on the Inite platform, these concepts form a new type of economy based on virtual assets and ideas: ideanomics.   

At the same time, Inite offers familiar gaming solutions from other metaverses, including:  

* Habitica – Gaming engine and setting based on task lists; 
* Fallout - SPECIAL character attributes;
* Final Fantasy – Magic and items;
* Theory of Invention Problem Solving - A type of popular intellectual card game designed to form a new type of thinking that improves cognitive functions, invented in the USSR in 1959.

Every Inite user has their own player character and can upgrade it by creating ideas. The main task for every player is the daily creation of 10 ideas and tracking their implementation. Inite players form an active community and discuss gaming activity. The best ideas get support from the community in the form of gaming clans and are tokenized as NFTs. Сompetition between characters and multiplayer clan raids on bosses are essential parts of the gaming process. 

### How Does Inite Work? 

The basic mechanic of the Inite platform is based on users writing out ideas every day and breaking them down into daily, monthly, and yearly intervals to help schedule time and set life goals. Ideas are represented in the form of NFTs. The player is choosing types of ideas and tasks that he likes by himself and has freedom to put into task lists any ideas that he likes. At the same time, since he needs to get support and likes for his ideas for other players, it is better to choose ideas that are understandable to a wider audience. Similarly, when selecting ideas, it is important to take care of improving the cognitive functions of the player, which is also the goal of the game.

Users not only suggest and fix their ideas, but are rewarded in game tokens (see below). Each idea can become the subject of discussion within the community and get support and feedback. And if a user generates revolutionary ideas, they can sell those innovations in the form of NFT tokens on the Idea Marketplace.  

Key features of the Inite platform are:

* Tokenized economy that allows to earn from your ideas
* Built-in market for buying and selling NFT items
* AI for generating ideas for a given theme
* Engaging battles with bosses
* Real-time communication with like-minded people
* Clan system and ability to create DAOs
* Referral system

### Introduction to the Gaming Process

The gaming interface includes areas for ideas, inventory, chat, clans, groups and challenges. From the start of the game, players can fill a list of ideas on a daily basis. There are different types of ideas dependent on their time frames. Ideas may be connected with individual tasks on a timescale measured in days, weeks, months or longer - or may even be life goals.

Ideas can also be categorized into business, charity, science and any other global areas, from proposing a specific initiative in the field of charity to ideas for remaking the world. For in-game progression, players join clans and perform tasks.
